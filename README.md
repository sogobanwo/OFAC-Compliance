# OFAC-Compliance-Checker

Simplify KYC and OFAC compliance for Web3 transactions with the **OFAC-Compliance-Checker**, built on **Farcaster**, powered by the **Self Protocol**, and integrated with **Celo** for tipping in **cUSD**, **USDT**, **USDC**, and **Celo**.

## Overview

The **OFAC-Compliance-Checker** is a decentralized solution designed to streamline regulatory compliance for small-scale Web3 transactions like airdrops and tipping. By leveraging **Self Protocol** for identity verification, **Farcaster** for decentralized social integration, and **Celo** for fast, low-cost stablecoin transactions, it eliminates the complexity of traditional KYC processes while ensuring users are not on OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) sanction lists.

## Problem

Web3 protocols and users face significant challenges with regulatory compliance:
- **Complex KYC Processes**: Time-consuming and costly, especially for low-value transactions like airdrops or tipping.
- **Regulatory Barriers**: OFAC compliance checks are mandatory but poorly suited for decentralized ecosystems.
- **Fragmented Tipping Systems**: Users need accessible, stable, and low-fee options for tipping in Web3 communities.

These hurdles limit participation, burden developers, and slow Web3 adoption.

## Solution

The **OFAC-Compliance-Checker** offers a user-friendly, decentralized approach to compliance and tipping:
1. **Create a Self Proof**: Users generate a verifiable digital identity credential via **Self Protocol** (self.xyz), with an embedded OFAC compliance check to confirm they’re not on sanction lists.
2. **Showcase Compliance**: Users display their OFAC-compliant status in their **Farcaster** profiles, building trust within communities.
3. **Tip Seamlessly**: Users send and receive tips in **cUSD**, **USDT**, **USDC**, or **Celo** on **Celo’s** blockchain, integrated into Farcaster frames for instant, low-cost transactions.
4. **Automate Compliance**: Protocols integrate the checker to verify compliance for airdrops or tipping, eliminating repetitive KYC.

## Features

- **Decentralized Compliance**: Built on **Farcaster** for transparent identity management and community trust.
- **Simplified KYC**: Replaces traditional KYC with a reusable **Self Proof** verified in seconds.
- **Stablecoin Tipping**: Supports **cUSD**, **USDT**, **USDC**, and **Celo** for fast, stable, low-fee transactions.
- **Scalable Integration**: Easy for developers to adopt via **Self Protocol** docs (docs.self.xyz) and **Celo** APIs.
- **User-Centric**: Intuitive interface for creating and sharing compliance status.

## Use Case

- A creator on **Farcaster** shares content. Fans create a **Self Proof**, verify OFAC compliance, and tip in **cUSD** or **USDC** via **Celo**.
- A protocol launches an airdrop, uses the **OFAC-Compliance-Checker** to confirm participant compliance, and distributes **Celo** tokens—all within **Farcaster**.

## Getting Started

1. **Visit Self Protocol**: Go to [self.xyz](https://self.xyz) to create a **Self Proof** with OFAC compliance verification.
2. **Join Farcaster**: Set up a profile on **Farcaster** to display your compliance status.
3. **Tip with Celo**: Use a **Celo**-compatible wallet to send/receive tips in **cUSD**, **USDT**, **USDC**, or **Celo**.
